We took 3 surf lessons with Lucky. We were experienced beginners, but Lucky really helped us correct our pop-up, read the waves, and learn important safety rules in the ocean and with the board. Although we already had some experience, he helped us feel much more stable on the board. We managed to catch our own waves independently.
He was super friendly and professional and hands down the best teacher we’ve had so far. We can definitely recommend him and would absolutely come back if we had the chance. 5/5
