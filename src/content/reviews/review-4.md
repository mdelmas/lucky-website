I had the pleasure of surfing with Lucky who is an outstanding instructor! He is super friendly, attentive to details when teaching. Throughout the lesson, he remained focused and was pointing and correcting mistakes, which significantly contributed to my progress. It was the best experience of surfing and learning together! After just two lessons, I noticed a considerable improvement in my skills and confidence in the water. I look forward to more classes ahead!🌊🏄🏻‍♀️🏄🏻‍♀️
