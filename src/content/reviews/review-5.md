I learned to surf on the south coast with several coaches, and Lucky is the best teacher I’ve ever had. He is a qualified, licensed surf instructor—very experienced and knowledgeable, yet always calm. Clear and effective guidance, and a great attitude. Deep down, he is already a wise old man with excellent teaching skills.
