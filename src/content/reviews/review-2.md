My girlfriend and I had two private lessons with Lucky. He effectively managed to adapt the lessons to suit our differing levels of experience so that we both improved. Lucky went above and beyond expected by extending our lessons and enlisting additional help so that our lessons was more effective. We would highly recommend Lucky, he clearly knows how to teach surfing much better and more safely than others on the beach.
