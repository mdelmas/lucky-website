    <h3>How I teach</h3>
    <p>
      I’m a certified ISA Level 1 instructor, with experience surfing both in
      Sri Lanka and abroad. My approach is simple: safe, friendly surf sessions
      that help you progress with confidence.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Safety first</strong> — calm, supportive coaching so you feel comfortable
        and confident in the water
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Clear guidance</strong> — simple explanations in English, both on
        the beach and in the waves
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Theory to practice</strong> — we break things down on land, then apply
        it in the water
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Local knowledge</strong> — I grew up surfing Hiriketiya and know the
        bay inside out
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Friendly progression</strong> — no pressure, just steady improvement
        while enjoying the ocean
      </li>
    </ul>
